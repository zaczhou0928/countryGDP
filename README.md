We are interested in innovative ways of representing countries’ GDP data over the years with visualization tools we have learned in class. Together we have decided to focus on the visualizations for the GDP data of German, Japan, and Italia. Therefore, we inquired about the annual GDP of these three countries from 2000 to 2022. We decided to choose the data for the three countries because these are the countries each one of us liked and wanted to explore the most.

Overall, we used a line chart since it provides clear and straightforward visualization for GDPs across the year. We had considered using a scatter plot, but it is not suitable for showing the dynamic changes of a single object. Additionally, scatter plots would have too many interactive points, making them overly dense. Therefore, we ultimately gave up using a scatter plot. The X-axis represents the years, and the Y-axis shows the GDP values (Unit: Billion Dollars). We also added some dots to highlight the GDP values of this country in specific years. 

Instead of providing an overcrowded visualization that stacks all the lines for different countries together, which is prevalent in most visualizations involved in GDP data, we choose to implement interactive techniques to display each country’s data by the users’ choice. In this way, we ensured that the visualization would not be too complicated to read, which enhances the clarity of our visualization.

The first thing to note is the interactive button in the upper left corner for switching between countries. By toggling between these three countries, we can visually observe the changes in the lines—we added a smooth animation to make our chart more dynamic. The title of the graph also changes dynamically to reflect which country is being selected. In addition, we have added an interactive function with dots. If you hover the mouse over this point, more specific relevant information will be displayed.

Our development process was a collaborative effort among three team members, each responsible for different aspects of the project. Together,  we selected the GDP data of Germany, Japan, and Italy as our dataset to visualize. Here's how the work was split:
Yunqi Zhang: Importing the data and creating the initial line plot. I mainly focused on preprocessing the GDP data for visualization, including handling any missing values and ensuring the data was in a suitable format for plotting. 
Yujun Fang: Implemented interactive features for the plot. I mainly worked on adding interactivity to the plot, specifically focusing on enabling a hover effect over data points. When the user hovers over a point on the plot, information about the GDP at that point is displayed, and that dot will turn red. This required integrating libraries or frameworks that support interactive elements into the visualization.
Qianjin Zhou: I implemented some visualizations such as title and labels for the axis. Developed functionality for selecting different countries to update the plot. I mainly worked on creating an interactive mechanism for users to choose different countries from a list or drop-down menu, with the plot updating dynamically to display the selected country's GDP data. This involved handling user input and updating the plot accordingly.
Finally, together, we finished the write-up of the rationale of our visualizations, and how we splitted our work. With each team member spending approximately 4 hours on the project, it gives us a total of 12 hours of development time. Updating the graph dynamically based on user input would be the most time-consuming aspect of the project.
